PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project aims to have a digital Elevator and also support lock system to be more secure and have many functionalities like:
* Lock system when calling the elevator 
* The elevator needs username and password from the user to access the elevator 
* If the user entered for the first time so must sign by username and password 
* If user ID already exist so he must enter his ID to access the elevator and he has max three trials 
* If the ID is not correct so user cannot able to access the elevator 
* If the ID is correct so can access the elevator  
* Up and down movement 
* If the user entered the ID correct so can use two buttons to go up and down 
* On and off to elevator 
* Reset elevator to normal mode 
* If the user pressed the up/down button for 2 sec the elevator will be reset
